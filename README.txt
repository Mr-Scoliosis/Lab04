This is a simple search function within a Binary Search Tree, coded in C.
To run, execute the makefile in powershell/ terminal.

Source Code contains the C, and all functions and structures are 
 contained within 'tree functinality'.
Insert and Create are contained within the same file, as very rarely 
 will they be ran separately from one another, and aren't within the main.

My git branches were just main and dev, as for such a simple project no 
 others were needed. Dev was used as the staging ground for functions as 
 I worked on them, and as such I did not dedicate a separate branch to 
 insert and search. Were I working on both functions simultaneously, or 
 in a more complex environment I would have deicated separate branches to 
 these.
